Fibrosis: Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lungs become scarred over time. Symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, feeling tired, weight loss, and nail clubbing. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and lung cancer.
Mass: A lung mass is defined as an abnormal growth or spot in the lungs larger than 3 cm or 1.5 inches in size. They are seen in x-ray or CT (computed tomography) scans of the lungs. They are not uncommon. They look like small, round growths of tissue surrounded by normal tissue. They can be single or multiple. Spots that are smaller than 3 cm in diameter are considered lung nodules. The evaluation process is different in both these cases.
